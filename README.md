Overview
This project aims to predict sleep disorders using a dataset related to sleep health and lifestyle factors. The notebook explores the dataset, preprocesses the data, and applies machine learning techniques to build a predictive model.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project is Sleep_health_and_lifestyle_dataset.csv, which contains various features related to individuals' sleep patterns, lifestyle habits, and health status. The target variable is the presence or absence of a sleep disorder.

Dependencies
The following Python libraries are required to run the notebook:

numpy
pandas
scipy
matplotlib
seaborn
You can install these libraries using the following command:

bash
Copy code
pip install numpy pandas scipy matplotlib seaborn
Notable Sections of the Notebook
Data Loading and Exploration: The dataset is loaded, and initial exploration is performed to understand the structure and content of the data.
Data Preprocessing: Missing values are handled, and necessary transformations are applied to prepare the data for modeling.
Modeling: Machine learning models are trained to predict sleep disorders based on the available features.
Evaluation: The models are evaluated based on their performance metrics, and results are visualized.
Usage
To run the notebook:

Clone the repository.
Place the dataset file (Sleep_health_and_lifestyle_dataset.csv) in the same directory as the notebook.
Open the notebook and run the cells sequentially.
